Let's discover **Codiac in less than 5 minutes**.

Codiac is the smartest way to deliver & run software on the cloud. Deliver your entire system of containers to any cluster on AWS or Azure with one drag.

## Getting Started

Get started with our **Quick Start Guide**.

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

# Intro cont.

Add **Markdown or React** files to `src/pages` to create a **standalone page**:

- `src/pages/index.js` → `localhost:3000/`
- `src/pages/foo.md` → `localhost:3000/foo`
- `src/pages/foo/bar.js` → `localhost:3000/foo/bar`

## Create your first React Page

Create a file at `src/pages/my-react-page.js`:

```jsx title="src/pages/my-react-page.js"
import React from 'react';
import Layout from '@theme/Layout';

export default function MyReactPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>My React page</h1>
      <p>This is a React page</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

A new page is now available at [http://localhost:3000/my-react-page](http://localhost:3000/my-react-page).

## Create your first Markdown Page

Create a file at `src/pages/my-markdown-page.md`:

```mdx title="src/pages/my-markdown-page.md"
# My Markdown page

This is a Markdown page
```

A new page is now available at [http://localhost:3000/my-markdown-page](http://localhost:3000/my-markdown-page).
